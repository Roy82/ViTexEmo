> Sharma, R., Kukreja, V. & Bhattacharjee, A. (2025). *ViTexEmo: A Multimodal Metadata Framework for Textual, Visual, and Emotional Enrichment in Digital Comic Archives.*

## üìò Overview
ViTexEmo is an AI-powered metadata framework designed to integrate textual, visual, and emotional information for enhanced management of digital comic archives.  
It automates metadata enrichment using **TextBlob** for textual emotion extraction and **ViT (Vision Transformer)** for visual emotion analysis.  
The framework supports **weighted multimodal fusion**, **semantic enrichment**, and **scalable evaluation** across large datasets.

## üß© Core Components
- **Data Preprocessing** ‚Äì Cleaning and structuring textual and visual inputs (JSON + image files).  
- **Textual Emotion Extraction (TextBlob)** ‚Äì Sentiment and emotion tagging from comic dialogues.  
- **Visual Emotion Extraction (ViT)** ‚Äì Emotion recognition from character expressions and scene colors.  
- **Weighted Fusion** ‚Äì Combines textual and visual emotion scores using optimal weights.  
- **Evaluation** ‚Äì Computes precision, recall, F1, AUC-ROC, MCC, and consistency metrics.
